Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to find the temperature trends for June and December. We first filtered out all the June temperatures by their dates in the years 2010-2018. We then converted the temperatures to a list and then into a dataframe. We finally calculated all the summary statistics for the dataframes with the average, standard deviation, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, total temperatures, etc.
